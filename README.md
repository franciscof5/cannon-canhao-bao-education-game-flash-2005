## Original game by Francisco Mat
I made the original version in Flash with objectives to launch and campaign, a training arena and an online version. But in that time I did not know how to handle server and socket communication to make real time communication, when I proposed a partnership with Samuel Kato, that intensive collaborate with project and developed an working demo, we actually played against each other via internet, at time (2007) it was a huge achievment, but Samuel dropped out project and keept the .php files that previously enabled server communication.

After that I became desmotived and decided to pause that project development, then I moved out to another city and started a new life away from Flash projects. At that time I thank I will assume development after a while, but it never happened and Flash became and obsolute technology in few months after that.

Today I recovered the offline version and I was very happy that I can take development from that stage. There is some things to finish, like ending game when lifebar ends, but the gameplay is almost done.

## Features
The game has some intersting features, even without online real time versus, the offline version has the majority code and design
* Original design, scenario and animated characters
* Original gameplay and game rules, like only 3 arrows by player
* Prototype artificial inteligence, in training arena, that is little hard to win, the CPU did not move but it was on roadmap

## Online version not working
The php files by Samuel Kato are lost, he did some improvments in .as files to handle socket communication, and that versions is on folder online. The game started consuming very resources from server and he decided to take socket and game off his server.
